What is a Network?
A network is a collection of interconnected devices (computers, routers, switches, etc.) that communicate with each other to share data and resources.

Types:

LAN (Local Area Network)

WAN (Wide Area Network)

MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)

PAN (Personal Area Network)
What is a Subnet?
Definition: A subnet (subnetwork) is a logically segmented portion of a larger network. Subnets divide large networks into smaller, more manageable pieces.

Purpose:

Improve performance and security.

Reduce broadcast traffic.

Example:

IP Address: 192.168.1.0

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Subnet range: 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254

What is MAC ID (MAC Address)?
MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique hardware identifier for a network interface card (NIC).

Assigned by manufacturers.

Format: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E

Used at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.

Purpose:

Identifies devices on the same local network.

Required for ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) mapping.

What is an IP Address?
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network.

Purpose:

Identify and locate devices.

Facilitate communication on a network.

Format:

IPv4: 192.168.1.1

IPv6: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
| Feature             | IPv4                           | IPv6                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |

| Format              | Decimal (e.g., 192.168.0.1)    | Hexadecimal (e.g., 2001\:db8::1)           |

| Header Complexity   | Simple                         | More complex with improved efficiency      |
| Security            | Optional (IPSec not mandatory) | Mandatory support for IPSec                |
| NAT Required        | Yes, due to limited IPs        | No, enough addresses for every device      |
| Used in             | Most current networks          | Slowly replacing IPv4, IoT and 5G networks |

Bridged Networking (VBox)
Bridged Networking: A VirtualBox network mode that allows the virtual machine to appear as a separate physical device on the same network as the host.

How it works:

The VM connects to the physical network via the host’s network adapter.

It receives its own IP address from the router (DHCP).

Use Case: Allows the VM to communicate with other devices on the LAN just like a real computer.

 VBox VDI (VirtualBox Virtual Disk Image)
VBox VDI: A Virtual Disk Image (VDI) file is the default virtual hard disk format used by Oracle VirtualBox, a type-2 hypervisor for running virtual machines.

Uses:

Stores the virtual machine's data (OS, files, apps).

Can be dynamically allocated (grows as needed) or fixed size (pre-allocated).

Example: A VDI file might be used to install Ubuntu in VirtualBox on a Windows host machine.

| Type       | Static IP Address                   | Dynamic IP Address              |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Assignment | Manually assigned                   | Automatically assigned by DHCP  |
| Changes    | Does not change                     | Changes periodically            |
| Stability  | More stable                         | Less stable                     |
| Cost       | Often costs more (ISP fee)          | Usually free (included by ISPs) |
| Use Cases  | Servers, security systems, websites | Home networks, general users    |
