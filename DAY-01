What is Ethical Hacking?

Ethical hacking refers to the process of legally breaking into computers and devices to test an organization's defenses. Ethical hackers, also known as **white-hat hackers**, are cybersecurity experts hired to find vulnerabilities in a system before malicious hackers (black-hat hackers) can exploit them.

Definition: Ethical hacking is the authorized practice of bypassing system security to identify potential data breaches and threats in a network.

Key Objectives:

* Identify security vulnerabilities.
* Strengthen system defenses.
* Prevent cyberattacks.
* Ensure compliance with security standards.

Who is an Ethical Hacker?

An **ethical hacker** is a security professional who uses the same tools and techniques as a malicious hacker but does so with permission to improve security.

**Roles of an Ethical Hacker:**

* Penetration testing
* Vulnerability assessments
* Social engineering simulations
* Risk assessment
* Reporting security flaws

Types of Ethical Hacking

Ethical hacking can be categorized based on **target systems** and **attack methods**:

1.Web Application Hacking

* Involves testing web applications for vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), CSRF, etc.
* Tools: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP

 2. Network Hacking

* Explores network devices, firewalls, switches, and routers.
* Focuses on sniffing, session hijacking, and denial of service attacks.
* Tools: Nmap, Wireshark, Aircrack-ng

3. **Wireless Network Hacking**

* Exploits weaknesses in Wi-Fi protocols like WEP, WPA, WPA2.
* Involves cracking keys, intercepting signals.
* Tools: Aircrack-ng, Kismet

 4. **System Hacking**

* Gaining unauthorized access to individual computers or servers.
* Involves password cracking, privilege escalation.
* Tools: Metasploit, John the Ripper

5. **Social Engineering**

* Tricking users into giving up confidential information.
* Techniques: phishing, pretexting, baiting.
* Tools: Social Engineer Toolkit (SET)

 6. **Mobile Hacking**

* Testing security of mobile applications and OS vulnerabilities (Android/iOS).
* Tools: Drozer, MobSF, Frida

 7. **Cloud Hacking**

* Assessing cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) for misconfigurations, data exposure.
* Tools: ScoutSuite, Prowler

Ethical Hacking Process (Phases)

1. **Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)**

   * Collecting data using tools or open-source intelligence (OSINT).
   * Types: Passive and Active Reconnaissance.

2. **Scanning**

   * Identifying open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
   * Tools: Nmap, Nessus

3. **Gaining Access**

   * Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain system access.
   * Tools: Metasploit, Hydra

4. **Maintaining Access**

   * Ensuring persistent access for further analysis.
   * May involve backdoors or rootkits.

5. **Clearing Tracks**

   * Removing evidence of the attack to avoid detection.
   * *Note: Ethical hackers simulate this step, but must not harm systems.*

6. **Reporting**

   * Documenting vulnerabilities and suggesting mitigation strategies.

Skills Required for Ethical Hacking

* Strong understanding of **networking protocols** (TCP/IP, DNS, etc.)
* Proficiency in **operating systems** (especially Linux)
* Knowledge of **programming/scripting languages** (Python, Bash, JavaScript)
* Familiarity with **cybersecurity concepts** (encryption, firewalls, IDS/IPS)
* Analytical thinking and **problem-solving** skills
* Understanding of **regulations and compliance** (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)

---

Legal and Ethical Considerations

* **Authorization is mandatory**: Only hack with written permission.
* **Confidentiality**: Maintain discretion of findings.
* **Non-disruptive**: Ensure no damage or downtime occurs.
* **Compliance**: Adhere to laws like:

  * Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (U.S.)
  * GDPR (Europe)
  * IT Act 2000 (India)

> Unauthorized hacking is **illegal** and punishable by law.

Black Hat vs White Hat vs Grey Hat

| Type      | Legality      | Intent                              |
| --------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Black Hat | Illegal       | Malicious, for personal gain        |
| White Hat | Legal         | Ethical, with permission            |
| Grey Hat  | Often Illegal | Exploratory, but without permission |
